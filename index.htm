    Come visit the new greenhouse and check out the colonies with our recently acquired exotic species.
    If you need a specific type of plant for your landscaping project, we can create a new cultivar to your specifications.
    No project is too big or small. We can populate an entire botanical garden or create a one-of-a-kind greenhouse. 
    Be the first to grow a tree of unknown origin.

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    
    We pride ourselves on generating growing art and flora that are out 
of this world. Our scientists and horticulturists are trained in the 
newest growth techniques and equipment. We have been cultivating 
extraordinary plants and landscaping gardens for over 90 years. We have 7
 offices in North America, and botanical gardens in New York, Oregon, 
and San Francisco. 
    We host events in cities nationwide to showcase our newest varieties
 and give you an opportunity to see some of the plants in person.  Visit
 the Events page to find out about upcoming events happening  in your 
location.

  <h3>Cloning species</h3>
    
    Horticulture cloning refers to generating descendants of a single 
plant by vegetative reproduction. Many horticultural plant cultivars are
 clones, that have been derived from a single individual, and then 
multiplied by a process other than sexual reproduction. For example, 
some strains of European grapes are clones that have been propagated for
 over two millennia. Other examples of clones are the potato and banana 
plants.
    Grafting is a technique that is similar to cloning, because the 
shoots and branches from the graft result in the creation of a genetic 
clone of a single individual plant. However, this type of cloning is 
typically classified as an entirely different kind of operation.
